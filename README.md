## Introduction
Aespa is a robust and intuitive Swift package for video capturing, built with a focus on the ease of setting up and usage. 

**This package provides a high-level API over Apple's `AVFoundation` framework**: abstracting away its complexity and making it straightforward for developers to implement video capturing functionalities in their iOS applications.

**This package provides a clean, user-friendly API for common video recording tasks**: including starting and stopping recording, managing audio settings, adjusting video quality, setting camera position, etc.


## Features
Aespa is designed to be easy to use for both beginners and experienced developers.  If you're new to video recording on iOS or if you're looking to simplify your existing recording setup, Aespa could be the perfect fit for your project.

*Before*
``` mermaid
graph LR
User --> RP["Permission Request"]
RP -- "Granted" --> AS["AVCaptureSession"]
AS -- "Connect" --> AI["AVCaptureVideoInput"]
AS -- "Connect" --> AIA["AVCaptureAudioInput"]
AS -- "Add" --> FO["AVCaptureFileOutput"]
FO --> PHCollectionListChangeRequest
```
**Aespa**
``` mermaid
graph LR
   User --"AespaOption"--> Aespa --"Aespa.configure()"--> Session
```

- Aespa provides an accessible API that abstracts the complexity of `AVFoundation`, allowing you to manage video capturing tasks with ease.

</details>

<details>
<summary> âœ… Offer essential preset configuration & customization </summary>

``` mermaid
graph TD
AS["AespaSession"]
AS --> RV["Recording a new video"]
AS --> Se["Change zoom, video quailty, camera position, ..."]
AS --> AV["Set options like stabilization, orientation ,..."]
AS --> D["Fetching asset files"]
```
- With Aespa, you can readily adjust a variety of settings. 
- For a higher degree of customization, it also supports the creation of custom tunings for the recording session, offering flexible control over your recording needs.

</details>

<details>
<summary> âœ… `Combine` & `async` support </summary>

``` mermaid
graph LR;
    A[Session update] -->|Trigger| B[previewLayerPublisher, ...]
    B -->|React to Changes| C[Subscribers]

		E[Background Thread] --Async--> F["Configure session"] --Finish--> A
```
- Aespa's API leverages Swift's latest concurrency model to provide asynchronous functions, ensuring smooth and efficient execution of tasks.
- Additionally, it is built with `Combine` in mind, enabling you to handle updates such as video output and preview layer  reactively using publishers and subscribers.

</details>

<details>
<summary> âœ… Comprehensive error handling </summary>

- The package provides comprehensive error handling, allowing you to build robust applications with minimal effort.

## Functionality
Aespa offers the following functionalities for managing a video recording session:

| Function                     | Description                                       |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `startRecording`             | Initiates the recording of a video session.       |
| `stopRecording`              | Terminates the current video recording session and attempts to save the video file. |
| `mute`                       | Mutes the audio input for the video recording session. |
| `unmute`                     | Restores the audio input for the video recording session. |
| `setOrientation`             | Adjusts the orientation for the video recording session. |
| `setPosition`                | Changes the camera position for the video recording session. |
| `setQuality`                 | Alters the video quality preset for the recording session. |
| `setStabilization`           | Modifies the stabilization mode for the video recording session. |
| `zoom`                       | Adjusts the zoom factor for the video recording session. |
| `setAutofocusing`            | Modifies the autofocusing mode for the video recording session. |
| `fetchVideoFiles`              | Fetch a list of recorded video files.             |
| `doctor`                       | Check if essential conditions for recording are satisfied. |

## Installation 
### Swift Package Manager (SPM)
Follow these steps to install **Aespa** using SPM:

1. From within Xcode 13 or later, choose `File` > `Swift Packages` > `Add Package Dependency`.
2. At the next screen, enter the URL for the **Aespa** repository in the search bar then click `Next`.
    ``` Text
    https://github.com/enebin/Aespa.git
    ```
3. For the `Version rule`, select `Up to Next Minor` and specify the current Aespa version then click `Next`.
4. On the final screen, select the `Aespa` library and then click `Finish`.

**Aespa** should now be integrated into your project ðŸš€

## Usage
### Requirements
- Swift 5.5+
- iOS 14.0+

### Getting started
``` Swift
import Aespa

let aespaOption = AespaOption(albumName: "YOUR_ALBUM_NAME")
let aespaSession = Aespa.session(with: aespaOption)

Task(priority: .background) {
    try await Aespa.configure()
}
```
> **Warning**
> Please ensure to call `configure` within a background execution context. Neglecting to do so may lead to significantly reduced responsiveness in your application. ([reference](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturesession/1388185-startrunning))


and so on. You can find the latest documetation in [here](https://enebin.github.io/Aespa/documentation/aespa/)
.Implementation examples are decribed in [here](##Implementation-Exapmles)


## Implementation Exapmles
### Start & stop recording
``` Swift
do {
    try aespaSession
        .setStabilization(mode: .auto)
        .setPosition(to: .front)
        .setQuality(to: .hd1920x1080)
        .mute()
        .startRecording()
} catch {
    print("Failed to start recording")
}

// Later...
try? aespaSession.stopRecording()

```

### Subscribing publihser
``` Swift 
// Subscribe file publisher 
aespaSession.videoFilePublisher
    .receive(on: DispatchQueue.global(qos: .utility))
    .sink { [weak self] status in
        guard let self else { return }
        switch status {
        case .success(let file):
            // Handle file
            // ex) return file.thumbnailImage
        case .failure(let error):
            // Handle error
            // ex)print(error)
        }
    }
    .store(in: &subsriptions)
```

## SwiftUI Integration

Aespa also provides a super-easy way to integrate video capture functionality into SwiftUI applications. AespaSession includes a helper method to create a SwiftUI `UIViewRepresentable` that provides a preview of the video capture.

### Example usage

```swift
import Aespa
import SwiftUI

struct VideoContentView: View {
    @StateObject private var viewModel = VideoContentViewModel()
    
    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            viewModel.preview
                .frame(minWidth: 0,
                       maxWidth: .infinity,
                       minHeight: 0,
                       maxHeight: .infinity)
                .edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.all)
        }
    }
}

class VideoContentViewModel: ObservableObject {
    let aespaSession: AespaSession
    var preview: some UIViewRepresentable {
        aespaSession.preview()
    }
    
    init() {
        let option = AespaOption(albumName: "Aespa-Demo")
        self.aespaSession = Aespa.session(with: option)
        
        Task(priority: .background) {
            do {
                try await Aespa.configure()
                try aespaSession
                    .mute()
                    .setAutofocusing(mode: .continuousAutoFocus)
                    .setStabilization(mode: .auto)
                    .setOrientation(to: .portrait)
                    .setQuality(to: .high)
                    .customize(WideColorCameraTuner())
                
            } catch let error {
                print(error)
            }
        }
    }
}
```
> **Note**: You can find the demo app in here([Aespa-iOS](https://github.com/enebin/Aespa-iOS))

> **Note**: In UIKit, you can access the preview through the `previewLayer` property of `AespaSession`. 
> 
> For more details, refer to the [AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturevideopreviewlayer) in the official Apple documentation.
